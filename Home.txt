I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

When I think about our book of work, I could come up with Fraud first (Fraud Prevention & Remediation process optimizations and monthly score card creation).
Apart from these, what I could think of one other item which you were also interested on was Monday.com. You liked this user board for our though it has some limitations in terms of expected features (related Jira). But not sue if it's really significant/urgent to ush it immediately to this Innovation program.

When I consider our portfolio of work, the first thing that comes to mind is Fraud Prevention and Remediation process optimizations, along with the creation of monthly scorecards. Additionally, another item that you showed interest in was Monday.com. You appreciated this user board for our team, despite some limitations related to expected features (compared to Jira). However, I'm not sure if it's significant or urgent enough to prioritize for immediate inclusion in our Innovation program.
