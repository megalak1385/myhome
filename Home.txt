1.	Current Process:
The Fraud Remediation team currently receives an automated end-of-day and monthly report in their email box from the Fraud Connect team, but it contains only high-level ticket details. This report lacks the necessary granularity, leaving the Fraud Remediation team and its senior management without visibility into activities at the detailed level of SLA time. To effectively identify delays caused by specific activities, there is a critical need for access to activity-level information.
The current report has at ticket level has the below fields.
2) New requirements:
a) Fraud remediation team wants to view both ticket and activity/task level information on the Tableau dashboard. 
  	This is a strategic solution: Display all ticket and activity/task level information containing  the details of cycle times and SLA breaches at activity level which will allow them to have a better visibility on 
    	Fraud ticket statuses & activities
    	The cycle time of each activity
    	Tickets approaching & exceeding SLA deadlines
b) Refer the below grids that has all the fields at ticket and activity level. These fields need to be added to the existing Fraud Tableau dashboard.
c) This grid also has the data mapping between the expected fields the fields that are available in the database that it can be mapped to.
3)SLA Definition:
    The SLA at task level has been shared with Fraud Tech Team (attached below) by the Business. This needs to be added into the backend data as the current data do not have the SLA information 
    and this should be the benchmark reference value to calculate the SLA breaches.
4)Current and Future state process models:
	The current and future process state models are attached below for future reference.
