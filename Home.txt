To avoid duplication of effort, the two requirements initially called for two separate Tableau dashboards. However, after conducting a fit gap analysis, the Boss team determined that they could integrate these requirements into the existing dashboard with a few enhancements. This decision effectively eliminates the need to build two additional Tableau dashboards. The typical timeline for building a Tableau dashboard is 4 to 5 months. By incorporating these two requirements into the existing dashboard, we save a total of 10 months in build time.
