Current Process - Manual:

The Margin team downloads the margin call report daily, applying CWM and 11D filters, as well as daily trades, and feeds them into their Alteryx workflow.
The Alteryx workflow consumes these two reports and generates the following Excel sheet, leaving columns N to R empty.
The team manually conducts analysis, referring to GCM and Connect screens, reviews business rules, calculates amounts, and updates the margin call amount and rationale.
New Process - Automation:

Automation should fill columns N to R in the table below, eliminating all manual tasks.
The Alteryx workflow must incorporate all business rules and calculate values accordingly.
Inputs should be sourced collectively from the various sources listed in the Inputs Table in Section 2.
Alteryx should update the same input file with additional values (Columns N to R, highlighted in yellow), saving it to their shared drive. No new files are necessary.
