I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

Thank you all for your time today.
As discussed, we can analyse the requirements and see 
-	If this requirement can be implemented within Qliksense without using Alteryx. 
o	The Qliksense can receive the arrangement ids and create the final report on the dashboard and email the report directly to individual/distros without having to store them in shared drive. 

Next Action Items:
-	Share the BRD with the Susan’s team (Who: Megala)
-	Review the Qliksense dashboard and data to see if everything is available (Who: Megala)
-	The team can look into the Business requirements and confirm if all of the business logics are feasible to implement in Qliksense script (Who: Shweta & Gopal)
-	Schedule some time for Tuesday/Wednesday to determine if this solution can be implemented in Qliksense (Who: Susan)
-	Share the Margin call report with Megala & Wendi (Who: Susan/Sweta/Gopal)

In the next meeting, we can discuss our operating model, division of work, upcoming projects, and the roles and responsibilities of our team and Saran's team, as we are combining efforts moving forward
Thank you all for your time today. Here is a summary of our discussion and the next steps:

Discussion Points:

We will analyze the requirements to determine if they can be implemented within Qliksense without using Alteryx.
Qliksense can receive the arrangement IDs and generate the final report on the dashboard. This report can then be emailed directly to individuals or distribution lists without storing them on a shared drive.
Next Action Items:

Share the BRD with Susan’s team
Who: Megala

Review the Qliksense dashboard and data to ensure all necessary information is available
Who: Megala

Evaluate the business requirements and confirm the feasibility of implementing all business logic in Qliksense script
Who: Shweta & Gopal

Schedule a meeting for Tuesday/Wednesday to determine the feasibility of the Qliksense implementation
Who: Susan

Thank you for your email Paige. We have received some inputs from Ayush which helped us to take this request further to Purvi’s team with more knowledge about what Snowflake can and cannot support. 
We are currently working with Purvi’s team to see how we can leverage Qlik to get what we need.


Your email is clear but could benefit from a bit of refinement for better readability and professionalism. Here is an edited version:

Subject: Update on Snowflake and Qlik Integration Efforts

Hi Paige,

Thank you for your email. We have received some valuable inputs from Ayush, which have helped us proceed with this request to Purvi’s team with a better understanding of what Snowflake can and cannot support.

We are currently collaborating with Purvi’s team to explore how we can leverage Qlik to get what we need.
