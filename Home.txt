I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

Thank you all for your time today.
As discussed, we can analyse the requirements and see 
-	If this requirement can be implemented within Qliksense without using Alteryx. 
o	The Qliksense can receive the arrangement ids and create the final report on the dashboard and email the report directly to individual/distros without having to store them in shared drive. 

Next Action Items:
-	Share the BRD with the Susanâ€™s team (Who: Megala)
-	Review the Qliksense dashboard and data to see if everything is available (Who: Megala)
-	The team can look into the Business requirements and confirm if all of the business logics are feasible to implement in Qliksense script (Who: Shweta & Gopal)
-	Schedule some time for Tuesday/Wednesday to determine if this solution can be implemented in Qliksense (Who: Susan)
-	Share the Margin call report with Megala & Wendi (Who: Susan/Sweta/Gopal)

In the next meeting, we can discuss our operating model, division of work, upcoming projects, and the roles and responsibilities of our team and Saran's team, as we are combining efforts moving forward
Thank you all for your time today. Here is a summary of our discussion and the next steps:

I am reaching out to schedule a review session with you to go over the progress I have made so far on the Xceptor build. I would estimate that approximately 50% of the build is complete, and I believe this session will be instrumental in addressing any questions and ensuring we are on the right track for the remaining work.

During our session, I would like to:

Review the completed portion of the Xceptor build.
Discuss and clarify any questions I have encountered while reviewing the Xceptor rules.

I am reaching out to you as Susan is currently on leave, and I was asked to contact you in her absence. Based on the recommendations from Susan and Shweta, we have decided to build the Tactical Shift requirement in Qlik Sense to make this a self-service tool. I will be collaborating with Shweta to implement this in Qlik Sense.

1.	Current Process - Manual:
-	Banking Ops team receives the OMN transactions and validates the client approvals for those transactions.
-	The validation is currently being done by Alteryx and this process has been already automation for daily run.
-	At the end, Alteryx workflow generates a consolidated list (excel sheet) of true exceptions and that need remediation actions from Ops team.
-	Ops team works on this excel sheet and maintains this entire population of tickets in excel and updates it on daily basis.
-	The team acts on each ticket and reach out to Advisors via email requesting an evidence of client attestation documents and their other communications with client.
-	While the team is working on the tickets, the ticket status would be in progress. Once they receive all the necessary documents in the email and they are satisfactory to Ops team, they mark the ticket complete.
2.	Problem Statement:
-	Maintain the entire population in excel sheet without any UX/UI
-	Hard to monitor the metrics, progress, and SLA of each ticket
-	Lack of visual representations such as graphs and charts 
-	Manual email communications and track of emails for each ticket 
-	Manual status changes of each ticket as they progress along
3.	New Process - Automation:
-	Alteryx workflow generates a consolidated list (excel sheet) of true exceptions and that need remediation actions from Ops team as it does today.
-	Unqork will read the recon file that was generated by Alteryx and generates a UX/UI Dashboard out of it.
-	Unqork will enable the user to view, edit and assign tickets on the dashboard.
-	It also allows the user add comments and attach evidences(files) with Unqork.
-	Overall, this application act as a one stop shop for the to complete the entire ticket life cycle.
Additional Details:
-	The process of reading the excel data should be automated to run it on daily basis.
-	The Unqork dashboard will show all the tickets and categorize into different groups based on the ticket status.
-	The dashboard also shows the charts and total counts of tickets under each category on top.
-	The dashboard should allow the user to edit the tickets based on their entitlements.
-	The dashboard should allow authorized users to assign the tickets to Front office team. Once the tickets have been assigned to someone, the system should notify the person by email with a dashboard link.
-	When user attempts to edit the ticket. It should display all the ticket details and all the user to add comments/change status/upload documents based on their roles
-	Automatic email notifications and file upload will make this application a one stop without relying on outlook emails



1. Current Process - Manual:

The Banking Operations team receives OMN transactions and validates client approvals for those transactions.
The validation is currently being performed by Alteryx, and this process has already been automated for daily runs.
At the end, the Alteryx workflow generates a consolidated list (Excel sheet) of true exceptions that require remediation actions from the Operations team.
The Operations team works on this Excel sheet, maintaining the entire population of tickets and updating it on a daily basis.
The team addresses each ticket, reaching out to Advisors via email to request evidence of client attestation documents and other communications.
While the team works on the tickets, the ticket status is marked as "in progress." Once all necessary documents are received via email and deemed satisfactory, the ticket is marked as "complete."
2. Problem Statement:

Maintaining the entire population in an Excel sheet without any UX/UI.
Difficulty in monitoring metrics, progress, and SLA of each ticket.
Lack of visual representations, such as graphs and charts.
Manual email communications and tracking of emails for each ticket.
Manual status updates for each ticket as they progress.
3. New Process - Automation:

The Alteryx workflow will continue to generate a consolidated list (Excel sheet) of true exceptions that require remediation actions from the Operations team.
Unqork will read the recon file generated by Alteryx and create a UX/UI dashboard from it.
Unqork will enable users to view, edit, and assign tickets on the dashboard.
Users will be able to add comments and attach evidence (files) within Unqork.
Overall, this application will serve as a one-stop shop for completing the entire ticket lifecycle.
Additional Details:

The process of reading the Excel data should be automated to run on a daily basis.
The Unqork dashboard will display all tickets, categorizing them into different groups based on ticket status.
The dashboard will also show charts and total counts of tickets under each category at the top.
The dashboard will allow users to edit tickets based on their entitlements.
Authorized users will be able to assign tickets to the Front Office team. Once tickets are assigned, the system will notify the assigned person via email with a dashboard link.
When a user attempts to edit a ticket, it will display all ticket details and allow the user to add comments, change status, and upload documents based on their roles.
Automatic email notifications and file uploads will make this application a one-stop solution, eliminating reliance on Outlook emails.
