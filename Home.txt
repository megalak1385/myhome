3.	Current Process - Manual:
-	The Margin team downloads the margin call report (applying cwm and 11d filters), daily trades and feeds them into their alteryx workflow. 
-	The alteryx workflow consumes those two reports and generates the below excel sheet with below details with no values on columns N to R. 
-	The team manually does the analysis referencing GCM and Connect screens, reviews the business rules, calculates the amounts, and updates the margin call amount and rationale

4.	New Process - Automation:
-	All manual tasks to fill columns N to R on the below table should be automated.
-	The Alteryx workflow should have all the business rules in place and calculate the values applying those business rules.
-	The inputs should be collectively sourced from different sources mentioned in section 2 inputs table.
-	As a result, alteryx should update the same input file with the additional values (Columns N to R that are highlighted below in yellow) and store it in their shared drive. No new files are required to be created here.
