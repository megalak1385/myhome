I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out about a pressing issue we encountered in production yesterday.

The currency dropdown, pulling options from Data Collection, lacks the "USD" option, affecting our business operations. Surprisingly, this option is available in UAT and staging environments.

Despite checking data collections and plugin versions, no discrepancies were found between environments.

Your prompt assistance in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.
