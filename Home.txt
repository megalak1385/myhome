"Let's start the meeting by providing some context on our previous discussions. As we all know, we're scheduled to migrate to Databricks in May. From May onwards, the data for the current Fraud Tableau dashboard will be sourced from Databricks. The Fraud Remediation team has requested the addition of Fraud Connect data to the existing Tableau dashboard, along with some enhancements. They currently receive ticket-level information through an Excel report and wish to incorporate this information into the dashboard, particularly focusing on activity-level details such as SLA.

Currently, our database only contains ticket-level information, and we lack SLA data for all activities. To address this, we requested SLA information from Pam in our last meeting. Pam promptly provided an Excel file with the SLA details. Upon receiving this information, I conducted research to assist with data mapping. Unfortunately, I was unable to precisely match all activity names from Pam's data with our data pull. I reached out to Pam, shared our data pull for reference, and requested her assistance in aligning the activity names and SLA data.

Pam graciously accommodated our request and returned the updated data to me, which I will share with the team after this meeting. Additionally, as discussed previously, I have created a Business Requirements Document (BRD) to outline the fields requested for inclusion in the dashboard. We can review this document during the meeting to determine the feasibility of adding these fields and proceed accordingly."
