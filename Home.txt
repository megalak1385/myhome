I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

Thank you all for your time today.
As discussed, we can analyse the requirements and see 
-	If this requirement can be implemented within Qliksense without using Alteryx. 
o	The Qliksense can receive the arrangement ids and create the final report on the dashboard and email the report directly to individual/distros without having to store them in shared drive. 

Next Action Items:
-	Share the BRD with the Susanâ€™s team (Who: Megala)
-	Review the Qliksense dashboard and data to see if everything is available (Who: Megala)
-	The team can look into the Business requirements and confirm if all of the business logics are feasible to implement in Qliksense script (Who: Shweta & Gopal)
-	Schedule some time for Tuesday/Wednesday to determine if this solution can be implemented in Qliksense (Who: Susan)
-	Share the Margin call report with Megala & Wendi (Who: Susan/Sweta/Gopal)

In the next meeting, we can discuss our operating model, division of work, upcoming projects, and the roles and responsibilities of our team and Saran's team, as we are combining efforts moving forward
Thank you all for your time today. Here is a summary of our discussion and the next steps:

I am reaching out to schedule a review session with you to go over the progress I have made so far on the Xceptor build. I would estimate that approximately 50% of the build is complete, and I believe this session will be instrumental in addressing any questions and ensuring we are on the right track for the remaining work.

During our session, I would like to:

Review the completed portion of the Xceptor build.
Discuss and clarify any questions I have encountered while reviewing the Xceptor rules.

I enjoy learning new and latest technologies in the current automation team. I am happy to be in a job where I build AI, rather than being in a job that can be replaced by AI
I am excited about expanding our team and look forward to learning new tools and technologies. My goal is to work on both individual and group assignments, leveraging this new knowledge to enhance our projects and overall performance.
Something you might not know about me is that I have a passion for interior design and enjoy writing stories
As a team, our goal is to significantly expand our growth and portfolio by developing more automation projects across Banking Operations using advanced AI tools on a larger scale. We aim to undertake key projects that attract greater attention, save more money for the bank, and enhance our team's reputation and credit.
We had a dog back in India named Tommy. I enjoyed playing with him, especially games like hide and seek. My sister would cover his eyes while I hid somewhere. When she let him go, Tommy would search for me and often find me, pulling at my skirt to 'rescue' me.
