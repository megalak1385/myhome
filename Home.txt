a. Ensure that results are aggregated at the arrangement level rather than the transaction level.

b. An arrangement may comprise multiple accounts, and each account may contain multiple transactions. All transactions must undergo individual validation for tactical benefit.

c. Business rules must be applied at the transaction level, potentially resulting in a mix of eligible and ineligible transactions. An arrangement becomes eligible if it contains at least one eligible transaction. Any ineligible transactions should be noted in the comment column.

d. Following rule application at the transaction level, results and conclusions should be consolidated and summarized at the arrangement level.

e. For arrangements with multiple eligible buy and sell transactions, the total market value of these transactions should be aggregated for market value calculation.

f. When assessing the sold position value for tactical benefit, transactions within an account must cover 100% of the buy amount. Partial curing at the account level is not permitted; if partial curing occurs, the entire account becomes ineligible for tactical benefit.

g. If Account 1 contains excess funds while Account 2 lacks sufficient funds to cover 100% of the required amount, Account 2 cannot borrow from Account 1. All rules must be enforced within each account to qualify for tactical benefit.

h. However, the total tactical amounts from all accounts may be combined to offset the final margin call amount. This offset may be either full or partial, depending on the cumulative tactical amount. The margin will be generated based on this amount alone.
