Subject: Update on Business Requirements Review and Timeline

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on our ongoing efforts to automate the end-to-end process and redefine certain business rules.

As we discussed, we've identified several tasks that are currently being handled manually, and our aim is to automate all calculations while refining these business rules within our existing workflow.

To ensure alignment and secure business sign-off, I'll be reviewing the finalized business requirements with the team tomorrow. Our goal is to have the business sign-off by the end of this week, allowing us to commence with the build phase starting next week.

Based on our initial estimates, we anticipate the build phase to take approximately two to three weeks. Once completed, we'll proceed with UAT testing, with an expected delivery by mid-April.

Please note that if there is a need to run the solution in production, it may require an additional month to complete the necessary governance processes and launch it into production.
