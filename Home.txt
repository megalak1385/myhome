1.	Risk Management:
  1.	Ticket level: More visibility helps reduce the population of past due
  1.	Today's overall ticket count = 699 (per year), out of this 120 are past due. If we can close at least 30 out of 120, its's a big win (17%). The definite target number % was not shared yet.
  2.	Identify the things that are almost past due and implement risk management strategies for x amount to not be past due
  3.	The Once past dues are identified in advance, they reach out to client and bankers have them close the tickets.  The more realistic and refined numbers were not given as it needs some research and analysis from their end.
  2.	Task/Activity level: More visibility at task/activity level helps them identify the tasks are causing delays or tickets stuck at specific stages, aiding faster resolution through strategic prioritization.
  1.	When all steps for a specific ticket are completed, it becomes eligible for escalation to the team, prompting a request for an explanation as to why the ticket has not been closed yet.
  2.	When some steps for a specific ticket are completed, it becomes eligible for escalation to the team, prompting a request for an explanation as to why the remaining steps have not been closed yet.
2.	Turn around/Avg time:
  1.	Avg time of ticket is 43.8 days today considering the entire inventory (entire population). This can be reduced using this report.
  2.	For some case types, we can reduce the turn around/resolution time (specific Fraud types) that do not really require many days (Quick hits)
  1.	Eg: Id theft and some scam cases and lost/stolen cases: This type typically has 14 days SLA. But if you are able to call a client and do all the required steps, it can be closed on the same/next day
Note: Given that you are able to coordinate with Banker/Client service team and reach out to client and have  all the information from the client upfront (UHNW clients can't be directly reached by Fraud team, it has to be coordinated by Client Service team)

Current State Metrics

Future State Metrics as a Result of the Improved Data

Current State - #s - not defined

future state to be defined but has goal

quick hits


•The SLA breach/Past due % varies every month between 10-20%.
• It was 12.5% last month and it was 17% in Dec. The intent is to bring this % to 10% for now. (Total tickets last month was 631. Out of which past dues were 79)
•KPIs - They check KPIs every month but it varies every month
•OKR - They tried to establish that last year
 
Goals:
•Reduce turnaround time and manual processes
•The goal was to find what is the overall turnaround time as far as the ticket would go
•Reduce the turnaround time (SLA)
•In Jan, the overall SLA time went down to 36 days. The intent is to bring it to below 30.
•Reduce the manual processes that they are doing. Improve the timestamp of each individual task (being a middle person and following up with multiple teams via emails)
•This report allows them to prioritize when there are multiple tickets with same kind of issues (Eg: 100 tickets are close to past due because of pending claim. They prioritize all of them and work with the team to close them). The Global Case report today is not accurate and found 25 to 30 difference
•Reduce Past dues:
•Avg time of ticket is 43.8 days today considering the entire inventory. This can be reduced using this report
•SLA - below 30 (goal)
•Past due - 10% (goal)
•Reduce manual processes
•Improve the timestamp
•The report will help improve the process and reduce the cycle time
