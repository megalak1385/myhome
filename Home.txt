I've incorporated the new fields and calculations we discussed last week into the BRD. Additionally, I've provided examples for clarity in the New Money rule (Business rules section, line item 7) and added item 8 â€“ additional rules based on our previous discussions.

Please review all sections and let me know if any changes are needed. If everything appears satisfactory, your sign-off would be appreciated. I will then proceed to eliminate the Snowflake data mapping so that I can collaborate with Susan directly.
