"Let's start the meeting by providing some context on our previous discussions. As we all know, we're scheduled to migrate to Databricks in May. From May onwards, the data for the current Fraud Tableau dashboard will be sourced from Databricks. The Fraud Remediation team has requested the addition of Fraud Connect data to the existing Tableau dashboard, along with some enhancements. They currently receive ticket-level information through an Excel report and wish to incorporate this information into the dashboard, particularly focusing on activity-level details such as SLA.

Currently, our database only contains ticket-level information, and we lack SLA data for all activities. To address this, we requested SLA information from Pam in our last meeting. Pam promptly provided an Excel file with the SLA details. Upon receiving this information, I conducted research to assist with data mapping. Unfortunately, I was unable to precisely match all activity names from Pam's data with our data pull. I reached out to Pam, shared our data pull for reference, and requested her assistance in aligning the activity names and SLA data.

Pam graciously accommodated our request and returned the updated data to me, which I will share with the team after this meeting. Additionally, as discussed previously, I have created a Business Requirements Document (BRD) to outline the fields requested for inclusion in the dashboard. We can review this document during the meeting to determine the feasibility of adding these fields and proceed accordingly."

Let me kick off this meeting with some background information about what we discussed last time. As we all know we are migrating to Databricks in May, and the data from current Fraud Tableau dashboard would be fed from Databricks from May onwards. The ask from Fraud Remediation team was to add Fraud Connect data to the existing Tableau dashboard along with some additional enhancements. As they are already receiving the Ticket level information today through the excel report today, they want to add those ticket level information with some additional information that are activity level especially with SLA. What you have today in your  database is only the ticket levelve information. As you don't have the SLA data for all activities, you have requested Pam to share the SLA information for all activities which was the action that we took from the last meeting and Pam has sent the excel file with the SLA. After receiving the SLA from Pam, I have done some research on my side to help you on data mapping as we have Pam's data and the Fraud Connect data pull that we got from your tech team. I tried to locate all her activity names on the data Pull that I had and unfortunately, I couldn't exactly locate those names. So I've reached to Pam and shared my data pull for reference and requested her to use those activity names and SLA for those. ANd Pam was kind enough to add those and sent it back to me which I can share with you after this meeting. Also as we discussed last time, I have created the BRD document to put together all the fields what they want to view on the dashboard which we can review in this meeting at high level and you can let us know what's is feasible to add to the dashboard and what's not and we can take it from there. 

"Alright, let's kick off this meeting with a quick recap of where we left off last time. So, as we all know, the big move to Databricks is coming up in May. That means our Fraud Tableau dashboard will start pulling data from Databricks from then on.

Now, the Fraud Remediation team had a couple of asks. They want to jazz up our existing Tableau dashboard with some Fraud Connect data and throw in a few extra bells and whistles. They've been getting ticket-level info in Excel reports, and they want to see that integrated into the dashboard, especially focusing on things like activity levels and SLAs.

Thing is, right now, all we've got in our database is ticket-level stuff. We're missing SLA data for most activities. So, in our last pow-wow, we reached out to Pam for help. Pam came through like a champ and sent over an Excel sheet with all the SLA details.

Now, I did some digging on my end to try and match up Pam's info with what we've got. But, wouldn't you know it, it's not as straightforward as I hoped. I shot Pam a quick message, shared our data with her, and asked if she could help line things up.

Good news, though! Pam came back with the goods, all matched up and ready to roll. I'll pass that along to everyone after the meeting.

Oh, and remember how we talked about putting together a list of fields for the dashboard? Well, I whipped up a little something called a Business Requirements Document (BRD). We can take a quick peek at it in this meeting, see what we can realistically add to the dashboard, and go from there."
