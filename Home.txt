We have received a request from OTS team to collect the BRD for the below Xceptor solutions so that they pick up these items next and begin with their requirement analysis. I was able to find the BRDs for most of these items(except for two) from our confluence page where we have proactively collected and archived all the BRDs for future implementation. 
If you could provide us the BRDs for the two items that I donâ€™t have in our repository, it would be great. I can add them to our confluence page and share them with OTS team. 
Also, please check the BRDs that I have attached here and let me know if anything has been changed in the interim. We can update them and share the updated version with OTS.
