I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

Thank you all for your time today.
As discussed, we can analyse the requirements and see 
-	If this requirement can be implemented within Qliksense without using Alteryx. 
o	The Qliksense can receive the arrangement ids and create the final report on the dashboard and email the report directly to individual/distros without having to store them in shared drive. 

Next Action Items:
-	Share the BRD with the Susan’s team (Who: Megala)
-	Review the Qliksense dashboard and data to see if everything is available (Who: Megala)
-	The team can look into the Business requirements and confirm if all of the business logics are feasible to implement in Qliksense script (Who: Shweta & Gopal)
-	Schedule some time for Tuesday/Wednesday to determine if this solution can be implemented in Qliksense (Who: Susan)
-	Share the Margin call report with Megala & Wendi (Who: Susan/Sweta/Gopal)

In the next meeting, we can discuss our operating model, division of work, upcoming projects, and the roles and responsibilities of our team and Saran's team, as we are combining efforts moving forward
Thank you all for your time today. Here is a summary of our discussion and the next steps:

1.	Current Process - Manual:
-	The Alteryx workflow consumes multiple reports created from multiple dashboards and applications such as RAC, ACAT, Reg and OMN. 
-	These reports provide all transactions and client approvals details.
-	After reading all these reports, Alteryx engine performs the review by validating the client approvals for each transaction. This process has been automated and currenly runs on daily basis.
-	At the end, the Alteryx workflow generates a recon file with pass and fail statuses for Ops team to review further
-	The operations team manually reviews this recon report especially the failed ones, do their further investigations to identify the true exceptions & false positives.
-	After their analysis, 
o	The team updates the statuses of failed ones, pass the false positives, and mark the true exceptions.
o	Create a consolidated tracker with all exceptions to track the exceptions and remediation actions. 
	This consolidated tracker has,
•	Exceptions with current statuses
•	Charts with trends 
•	Ratio of pass and fails (Includes both Alteryx and manual reviewer counts)
o	This team would be updating the tracker based on the progress and updates they receive from the remediation team.
-	The team maintains the entire population of tickets and updates it on a daily basis.
2.	Problem Statement:
-	Difficulty in monitoring metrics, progress, and SLA of each ticket.
-	Maintaining the entire population in an Excel sheet with no user friendly UX/UI interface.
-	Low performance due to continuously growing and large amount of data.
-	Less reliability as the excel could potentially crash due to high volume of data
-	Involves lot of manual intervention whish is really time consuming:
o	Manual email communications and tracking of emails for each ticket.
o	Manual status updates for each ticket and charts as they progress.
o	Manually adding the transactions and the ratio of pass & fails to the consolidated report
3.	New Process - Automation:
-	The Alteryx workflow will continue to generate a recon file (Excel sheet) for operations team to perform their further investigations.
-	Unqork will read the recon file generated by Alteryx and create a UX/UI dashboard from it. 
-	The process of reading the Excel data should be automated to run on a daily basis.
-	The consolidated list of all tickets will live on this dashboard and allow the users to filter out by dates, statuses, and reasons etc.
-	The dashboard should also display the charts and total counts of tickets based on their status, reason etc.
-	Unqork will categorize the pass and failed ones. Under failed ones, it will further classify the tickets based on the reason and show them as subcategories.
-	Unqork will enable users to view, edit, and assign the individual tickets on the dashboard based on their entitlements.
-	Users will be able to change statuses, add comments, and attach files (if needed) within this application.
-	All the updates should be saved once the user makes the updates and saves the ticket.
-	Unqork should allow user to email the consolidated report to the group.
-	Unqork should send the email notifications when the tickets are assigned to the individuals.
-	Overall, this application will serve as a one-stop shop for completing the entire ticket lifecycle.

After validation, the Alteryx workflow generates a recon file with pass and fail statuses for further review by the Operations team.
The Operations team manually reviews this recon report, focusing on the failed transactions to identify true exceptions and false positives.
Post-analysis, the team:
Updates the statuses of failed transactions, passes false positives, and marks true exceptions.
Creates a consolidated tracker to monitor exceptions and remediation actions. This tracker includes:
Current statuses of exceptions
Charts displaying trends
Ratios of pass and fail statuses, including counts from both Alteryx and manual reviewers
Continuously updates the tracker based on progress and feedback from the remediation team.
The team maintains and updates the entire population of tickets daily.
-	Team details:
o	All the validation, consolidation & monitoring processes are currently being performed by Operations team today (two reviewers and one SME).
o	Once the exceptions are identified by Ops team and communicated to Front Office team, the Front office team will take all the remediation actions and notify the Operations team upon completion.
o	After remediation, the Operations team will do the final review and close the transactions by marking it cleared. 


2. Problem Statement:

Difficulty in monitoring metrics, progress, and SLAs for each ticket.
Maintaining all data in an Excel sheet, which lacks a user-friendly UX/UI interface.
Performance issues due to the growing volume of data, leading to potential Excel crashes.
Time-consuming manual processes, including:
Email communications and tracking for each ticket

Overall, this application will serve as a comprehensive solution for managing the entire ticket lifecycle, streamlining processes, and improving efficiency.
-	Process Ownership/Workflow:
a.	Operations team assigns the tickets from the Operations public queue.
b.	Once the exceptions are identified by Ops team, the reviewer assigns the transactions to the Front Office team member. 
c.	The assigned Front office team member completes all remediation actions and assigns the transactions back to the reviewer in Operations team.
d.	The reviewer from Operations team conducts a final review and close the transactions by marking them as cleared. 
e.	Each time when the owner is changed, the notification should be sent to the individuals from Unqork.


The Operations team, which includes two reviewers and one Subject Matter Expert (SME), is responsible for all validation, consolidation, and monitoring activities.
Once exceptions are identified by the Operations team, they communicate these to the Front Office team.
The Front Office team is tasked with performing all necessary remediation actions and informing the Operations team upon completion.
Following remediation, the Operations team conducts a final review to ensure all issues have been addressed and then closes the transactions by marking them as cleared.


The Operations team is responsible for initially assigning tickets from the Operations public queue.
Once exceptions are identified, the Operations reviewer assigns the transactions to a designated Front Office team member for remediation.
The Front Office team member executes all necessary remediation actions and then reassigns the transactions back to the Operations reviewer.
The Operations reviewer conducts a final review of the remediated transactions and closes them by marking them as cleared.
Each time a ticket changes ownership, Unqork automatically sends a notification to the relevant individuals to ensure seamless communication and tracking.
