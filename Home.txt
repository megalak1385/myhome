I have recently learned a few things from my other automation teams with respect to Alteryx to Snowflake data movement. As I am building my Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm what I learned is correct with you. If yes, I want to discuss the below points as it might impact our BAU team (GCM team)
I want to confirm the below points:
- Snowflake classifies the data into two categories 1) Credit Orbit data 2) Galaxy data
- Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx but the credit orbit data is npt allowed to be accessed from Alteryx using FID in prodution env.
- If we want to access Credit Orbit data, it has to be accessed via Qliksense or Unqork (Unqork for meridian data & Qliksense for Midori data)
My questions:
- Does qliksense have the live data? if no, how many days delay can we expect?
- Can we get both galaxy & Credit Orbit data from Qliksense?
- How can we query in qliksense when we need data from multiple tables?
- Can we extract the qliksense data and store it in Shared drive?
I have attached the data modle that we received from other teams here for your reference.

I recently gained some insights from our other automation teams regarding the movement of data between Alteryx and Snowflake. As I am currently developing the Tactical Shift solution in Alteryx, I want to confirm the accuracy of this information with you. This is crucial since it could impact our Business As Usual (BAU) team, specifically the GCM team.

Here are the key points I need confirmation on:

Data Classification in Snowflake:
Snowflake classifies data into two categories: 1) Credit Orbit data and 2) Galaxy data.
Galaxy data can be accessed from Alteryx, but Credit Orbit data cannot be accessed from Alteryx using FID in the production environment.
Access to Credit Orbit data requires either QlikSense or Unqork (with Unqork for Meridian data and QlikSense for Midori data).
I have a few questions regarding this:

Live Data in QlikSense:

Does QlikSense provide live data? If not, what is the expected delay?
Data Accessibility in QlikSense:

Can both Galaxy and Credit Orbit data be accessed through QlikSense?
Querying Multiple Tables in QlikSense:

How can we perform queries in QlikSense that require data from multiple tables?
Data Extraction and Storage:

Is it possible to extract data from QlikSense and store it on a shared drive?
For your reference, I have attached the data model received from other teams.

I appreciate your assistance in confirming this information and look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
