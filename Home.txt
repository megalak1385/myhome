Hello Team,
I am sending this to place a request to complete one of the open Unqork dashboard tickets in the production environment. 
AS this project is in testing phase in production and due to multiple unexpected status changes, the Unqork workflow has moved this ticket to the end node and not allowing the user to edit anymore through the UI. So we are enforced to complete this ticket from the backend database. 
Here is the ticket, module and workflow details. Please let us know if you need any more information from me. If you need Business approval, we can provide that as well.
Request id: WMLC-100011
Module id: 65cd10d8f26ea6f904a29791
Workflow: https://jpm-wm.unqork.io/auth/saml?idp=JPMC-WM-PROD&destination=%23/workflow/e2eletterofcredit20230207/e2elcengagementform
